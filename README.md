An automatic traffic light controller designed using VHDL utilizes digital logic to manage traffic flow at intersections. It employs sensors to detect vehicles or pedestrians, timers to control signal durations, and state machines to coordinate signal changes. VHDL's entities define inputs, outputs, and signals, while architectures specify control logic. Using conditional statements and finite state machines, the controller transitions between signal phases based on detected conditions, optimizing traffic flow and safety. This VHDL-based approach enables the creation of efficient and customizable traffic light control systems for real-world deployment.
